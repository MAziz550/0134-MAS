Five-minute hypothesis
The five-minute hypothesis is a skeptical hypothesis put forth by the philosopher Bertrand Russell, 
that proposes that the universe sprang into existence five minutes ago from nothing, 
with human memory and all other signs of history included. 
It is a commonly used example of how one may maintain extreme philosophical skepticism with regard to memory 
and trust in evidentially derived historical chronology.
